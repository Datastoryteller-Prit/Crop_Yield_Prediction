In this project, I developed a multiple linear regression model after verifying the linearity assumptions. The model achieved an R-squared value of 81%, indicating that 81% of the variability in the dependent variable is explained by the predictors. Additionally, the model resulted in a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.25, reflecting the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
